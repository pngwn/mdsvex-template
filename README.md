# mdsvex-template

A simple template to get started with mdsvex. This uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Anything you can do with kit, you can do with this.

## Creating a project

Clone this repo, or use GitHub's green 'Use this template' button in the top right or use [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```bash
npx degit pngwn/mdsvex-template#main my-project
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
